##What's micro?
Micro is a timestamp microservice that works! It was created as a part of Free Code Camp Back End Certification. You can pass a Unix time or a more readable date. The microservice will return the json for both!

##User stories:
- I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)
- If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
- If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
